An implementation details overview of the underlying LOVR methodology of the vocab-recommender framework has been accepted as a demo/poster paper, under the title _Towards a Vocabulary Terms Discovery Assistant_, that was submitted to the [SEMANTiCS 2016](http://2016.semantics.cc/main-conference) conference that will take place in Leipzig in September. 

Looking forward to attend one more great SEMANTiCS conference and demonstrate the working prototype.
