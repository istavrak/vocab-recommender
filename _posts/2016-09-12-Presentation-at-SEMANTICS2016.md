The research paper was presented at SEMANTICS2016 at the [Data Science](http://2016.semantics.cc/main-conference) track. The slides have already been shared online via [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/istavrak/linked-open-vocabulary-ranking-and-terms-discovery). The  conference included many very interesting talks in various topics related to the Semantic Web.

The keynote presentations were mostly project-oriented, reflecting the main aim of the SEMANTiCS conference, the application of research on the various industrial sectors.

The poster-demo submission was nominated as one of the top 5 of the conference, which made it eligible for inclusion in the main proceedints published by ACM.

I'm glad that the presentation of the research paper took place in a room full of participants in front of a great audience.

The posters were presented in the main meeting point around the registration desk and the coffee tables, which helped them to attract more eyes.

Among the presented posters was also the poster for the vocab-recommender that was accompanying the main research paper.
